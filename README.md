# shake-and-boom-kiosk
Backup for the Drew shake and boom kiosk

This repository contains some scripts that I used to setup a kiosk to display
data from our Raspberry Shake and Boom device installed at our school.

I basically followed the Raspberry Pi Foundation's guidelines for setting up
a kiosk on a Raspberry Pi 4. I modified the script to fetch the configuration
URLs from a file using curl.  I also set the machine to reboot every night.

If you are a part of the Drew Charter School community, there is an internal 
writeup about the earthquake monitor saved on the STEAM shared drive under 
Makerspaces/Exhibits/JA Exhibits/Georgia Tech EAS Seismograph
